### AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam - Domain 2 Study Guide: **Security and Compliance**

---

### **Overview of Domain 2:**

This domain focuses on understanding the core AWS services, concepts, and tools for security and compliance. It accounts for 25% of the exam and covers the following key areas:

1. **Defining the AWS shared responsibility model**
2. **Defining AWS Cloud security and compliance concepts**
3. **Identifying AWS access management capabilities**
4. **Identifying resources for security support**

---

### **1. AWS Shared Responsibility Model**

The AWS Shared Responsibility Model is a fundamental concept that delineates the security responsibilities between AWS and the customer.

- **AWS Responsibility (Security *of* the Cloud):**
    - AWS manages the physical infrastructure and hardware, including:
        - **Physical Security**: AWS data centers, networking, and hardware.
        - **Software Security**: The AWS Global Infrastructure, managed services, and foundational services (like EC2, S3, etc.).
- **Customer Responsibility (Security *in* the Cloud):**
    - Customers manage security **in** the cloud, including:
        - **Data Protection**: Encrypting data, managing access, and ensuring integrity.
        - **Identity and Access Management**: Setting up and managing users and permissions.
        - **Configuration Management**: Securing applications, operating systems, and network configurations.

### **2. AWS Security and Compliance Concepts**

### **Security Concepts:**

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**
    - **Users, Groups, and Roles**: Create and manage AWS users, groups, and roles to define permissions.
    - **Policies**: Attach policies to IAM entities to grant appropriate permissions.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security.
- **Encryption:**
    - **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt data stored in AWS services (e.g., S3, EBS, RDS) using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
    - **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS/SSL for secure data transmission.
- **Network Security:**
    - **Security Groups**: Act as a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.
    - **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**: Provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level.

### **Compliance Concepts:**

- **AWS Compliance Programs**: AWS adheres to global compliance programs like SOC, ISO, and GDPR. Customers can leverage these compliance frameworks by using AWS services.
- **AWS Artifact**: A portal that provides on-demand access to AWSâ€™s security and compliance reports.

### **3. AWS Access Management Capabilities**

- **IAM Best Practices:**
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant permissions that are necessary for the task.
    - **IAM Policies**: Use managed policies to enforce security.
    - **Root Account**: Secure the root account and avoid using it for everyday tasks.
- **Federated Access**: Integrate on-premises Active Directory (AD) or other identity providers for federated access using AWS IAM roles.
- **Access Logs**:
    - **AWS CloudTrail**: Logs all API calls, including who made the call, which resources were used, and when.
    - **AWS Config**: Tracks configuration changes in your AWS resources and evaluates these changes against your configurations.

### **4. Resources for Security Support**

- **AWS Security Hub**: Provides a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS and helps you check your environment against security best practices.
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Offers real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices, focusing on cost optimization, performance, security, and fault tolerance.
- **AWS Inspector**: An automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.

### **Study Tips:**

- **Understand IAM deeply**: Know how to create policies, manage user permissions, and enforce security best practices.
- **Learn the Shared Responsibility Model**: Be clear on what AWS manages and what you are responsible for.
- **Practice with Security Tools**: Familiarize yourself with AWS security services like CloudTrail, Inspector, and Security Hub.
