- What is Cloud Computing?
    - Cloud computing is accessing on demand  IT resources  over the internet.
- What are the three deployment models for cloud computing, their definitions, and uses?
    - There are three different deployment models for cloud computing including public, private and hybrid. Public is where the IT resources are accessed through the cloud. Private the resources are on premise in the physical building. Hybrid is a mix of both where some resources are accessed through the cloud while others are on site.
- What are the Benefits of cloud computing and their definitions?
    - The benefits of cloud computing is the cost, scalability , availability to pay as you go pricing.
- What are the Amazon EC2 instance types and their definitions?
    - There are three types of instances that EC2 offer which are general purpose, compute optimized and memory optimized. General purpose is typically for web servers or workloads that don't always use the CPU. Compute is for machine learning or other modeling applications that require from high performance processors. Memory optimized instances are designed to offer faster performance that require a lot of memory.
- What is a Load Balancer?
    - Load Balancing distributes the load as evenly as possible to different IT resources in order to not have one IT resource handle all of the stress.
- What is the primary purpose of AWS Regions in the global infrastructure?
    - AWS Regions contains isolated locations of availability zones with servers in order to provide quick access to different places and customers in different locations.
- Describe the function of Amazon CloudFront in AWS's architecture.
    - CloudFront is used to distribute content to different locations with low latency and speed.
- How do AWS Edge locations enhance the performance of Amazon CloudFront?
    - AWS Edge locations help enhance performance by having cached content in various places in order to deploy them to customers.
- Explain how Amazon Route 53 integrates with AWS Edge locations to enhance user experiences.
    - Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service which help since it can provide low latency responses based on the location of the customer.
- What are the advantages of using AWS Outposts for local data processing needs?
    - The advantages of AWS Outputs for local data processing needs is that if there is a reason for having hardware on premise it can be done while using amazonâ€™s services.

- What is AWS Outposts?
    - AWS Outposts refers to when customers need access to physical hardware but still want to use AWS Services.
- How do Availability Zones within AWS Regions contribute to disaster recovery and high availability?
    - Different availability zones have redundancy with the data that is stored and allows data to be saved in case of disaster.
- How do AWS Edge locations and Amazon CloudFront improve content delivery?

    - Containers have the advantage of being OS independent.
- What is serverless computing and its use cases?
    - Serverless meaning donâ€™t have to depend on the underlying server that it is being hosted on.
- When would you consider a hybrid deployment model?
